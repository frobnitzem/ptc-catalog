# Manage a Large Project by Creating and Managing Working Groups

## User Story

As a team member, I want to know my working group tasks and deadlines so we can work effectively as an independent unit.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No working-groups. |
| 1 | Team-members assigned to named groups by areas of interest and expertise. |
| 2 | Each working group has a group lead and written, well-defined scope. |
| 3 | Group leads take ownership of their group's deliverables and report on progress at each meeting. |
| 4 | Inter-group communication propagates work items to the right place. |
| 5 | Group-managed, written, synergetic goals, deliverables, and timelines cover all team tasks. |

## Comments

- This model applies to a model like Scrum-of-Scrums, where a project team is naturally
sub-divided into more than one problem area that technically distinct
(e.g. producing results vs. computational kernel tuning).
